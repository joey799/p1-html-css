        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of the web. Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>

            <section><h2>Img-tag</h2>
                <p>This element will display an image on the screen. It will always have an ‘src’ attribute which points to the address of the image to be displayed. NOTE: img tags can be self-closing, as in they do not need two tags. Simply put the / before the closing bracket in the first tag:</section>
